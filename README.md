- [Synthetic data generated by RDyn](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_qHCX4CYbmanZIHBeA1w6RaG61CKQhzw?usp=sharing)

## Usage

- Run `run_change_point_discrete.py` cell by cell to get the result of MDCPD in DTDG modeling scenario.
- Run `run_change_point_temporal.py` cell by cell to get the result of MDCPD in CTDG modeling scenario.
- To get the results for official implemented TILES, you need to run `run_tiles_cpd.py`.
